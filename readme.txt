Hello User!.
This is just a documentation if you want to use this app on your System.

1. Make sure you have python 3.

2. Make a virtual environment on your system

3. Copy my final_project folder in to the same directory as the virtual environment.

4. Install django, crispyforms,pillow into this virtual environment.

5. IMPORTANT: Note that i will remove the google calender token out of my project because it corresponds
to my personal google calenders. You might want to open google developers console, create a new project 
and create an OauthContentScreen and add some credentials get get the calender api.For this, you can refer to:
This is where i learnt ;) . Just follow the video below.

For using Forgot Password feature:
6. Note that you also want to save your gmail email and gmail password as private environment 
variables in your pc as "MY_EMAIL" and "MY_PASSWORD"(quotes not needed).
If you have double verification enabled on your gmail account you might have to allow access by 3rd party apps 
and set password for your app access.

ENJOY!!!
